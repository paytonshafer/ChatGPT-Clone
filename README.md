# ChatGPT Clone
This my ChatGPT clone created using React for the frontend and a Node.js server for the backend. The page has the ability to send a message and using the OpenAI API get a response from the model gpt-3.5-turbo. The user will have the ability to create a new chat as well as revisit their previous chats using the history on the side. The user can also choose to delete a chat by pressing the X next to the chat they want to delete. By default the app opens in dark mode but by using the toggle in the bottom left the user can switch back and forth between light and dark modes. The API calls are done by the backend and the frontend makes a POST request to the backend which then takes the POST from the frontend and does a POST to OpenAI and returns the response to the frontend. 

# Usage
You will first need to clone the repository and cd to the chatgpt-clone directory
